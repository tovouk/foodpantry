                        <p>We are a family based non-profit that was struggling to make ends meet.
                        We would often not have enough food in our kitchen for a filling meal.<br> We
                        created this company to make sure families, and individuals, would never
                        have to experience the same thing we did. Read more below</p>

                            <p>In 1995, Tim Burton and Sarah Burton could not afford to buy the necessary
                            supplementation for their family, them and their three kids.<br>
                            Not only was it stressful, but the feeling of constant hunger was
                            reducing their quality of life. How was it that a family with two working<br>
                            class adults could not afford to meet the basic needs for survival?</p><br>
                            <p>
                            One night their daughter asked, "Mom, I wish we had a farm, that way we
                            wouldn't have to buy the food." The rest was history.<br>
                            Tim and Sarah, along with their kids, took up gardening in their spare time and
                            even managed to get a local contract with grocery stores nearby.<br>
                            Soon after they could afford a few acres and made it their mission to 
                            help others in need with the help of generous partners against diversity.

                            <p>In our spare time, we Burtons would go to the local home depot
                            and buy seeds and water them. This eventually led to an increase in size<br>
                            to our garden. We had apple trees, tomatoes, potatoes, orange trees, banana
                            trees, you name it! If it was in season we had it!</p><br>
                            <p>We would like to give a special thank you to Sarah's friend, Jasmine, who
                            gave great gardening advice during the come up.</p>

                            Sarah would often go volunteering to a local food pantry and noticed that they
                            had a limit to how many times a month someone could go. Having experienced 
                            immense hunger in the past, she did not see this as something right. She mentioned
                            this phenomena to her family during dinner and wouldn't you know, their daughter 
                            said, "Why don't we start a food pantry where anyone is welcome at any time?"</p><br>
                            <p>
                            With the prosperous growth of the Burton Family Farm, a nonprofit rose from
                            the ground up. The Burton family had plenty of food now, and money as well. 
                            It is our goal to make sure anyone in need gets well taken care of, no
                            if's, and's, or but's about it.</p>
